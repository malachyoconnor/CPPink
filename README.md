# CPPink

A C++ cannibalization of a C library for generating images on an eInk screen.
Removing unused parts and will be rewriting the library in C++.

Eventual Goal:
    Once I've grown tired of faffing around with languages, actually the use the screen for displaying
    train times.

## Uses Lib files from https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper
